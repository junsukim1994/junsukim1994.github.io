Currently studying for graduate school for Ph.D in Statistics.

■ Bachelor of Science at New York University in Mathematics.
■ Served as Bootcamp Instructor at S.Korean Army.
■ Developer of [Do.now](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/do-now/id1584547112) App on the iOS App Store.

After discharged from South Korean Army, I worked briefly as an iOS developer at a small company in South Korea. I have an app on the iOS App Store named [Do.now](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/do-now/id1584547112) that helps people organize their todos in a more organized, efficient way. I quit my job in February, 2022 to study for graduate school for Ph.D degree in Statistics. And I am currently studying day and night at local cafes.

I am also an avid writer. I write on [Medium](https://medium.com/@junsu-kim) and [Velog](https://velog.io/@junsukim1994) about iOS, Statistics, Culture, and Life. If you are interested, head over and check out my articles.
